 SIADH</strong></p>
<p>
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition that occurs when the body produces too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. This causes the body to retain too much water and can lead to low levels of sodium in the blood, also known as hyponatremia.

<p><strong>Symptoms of SIADH include:</strong>
</p>
 
<ul>
	<li>Nausea and vomiting <li>
Headache</li> <li>
Balance problems </li><li>
Mental changes, such as confusion or memory problems</li> <li>
Seizures or coma in severe cases
</li>
</ul>
 
<p>
SIADH can be caused by central nervous system abnormalities, such as stroke, hemorrhage, infection, trauma, mental illness, or psychosis. Small cell lung cancer is the most common tumor that can lead to SIADH.
Treatments for SIADH include fluid restriction and medications to adjust electrolyte balance. Underlying conditions that may be causing SIADH should also be treated.
