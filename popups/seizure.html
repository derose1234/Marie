<strong>Seizure</strong></p>
<p>
A seizure is a temporary, abnormal burst of electrical activity in the brain that can cause a person to experience a sudden change in behavior, movement, or consciousness. Seizures can look different from person to person and can include: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Uncontrolled shaking 
 <li>Staring into space 
 <li>Loss of consciousness 
 <li>Unusual sensations or thoughts 
 <li>Involuntary twitching or stiffness 
<li>Severe stiffening and limb shaking 
<li>A feeling of deja vu 
 <li>Blurred vision 
 <li>Racing thoughts 



</li>
</ul>


<p>
Most seizures last less than two minutes and stop on their own. However, the person experiencing a seizure can be injured, so it's important to protect them. If you encounter someone having a seizure, you can:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Help them to the ground in a safe area </li>
  <li>  Clear the area of sharp objects </li>
    <li> Loosen any tight clothing </li>
    <li> Turn the person on their side </li>
   <li>Stay with the person until they recover or medical help arrives 

</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some common causes of seizures include high fever, medication, infections, low blood sodium, brain injury, or a tumor. Recurring seizures are known as epilepsy, which can vary in severity and impact from person to person.
