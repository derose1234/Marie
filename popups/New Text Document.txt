A hematoma, also spelled hematoma, is a collection of blood that pools outside of a blood vessel in an organ, tissue, or body space. Hematomas can be caused by trauma or disease, such as an injury or surgery that damages a blood vessel.   

 Hematomas 
 Appearance: A localized hard mass that can be dark blue or black, or cause significant redness 
 Causes: Trauma or injury, such as a direct hit to a vein or artery
 Treatment Minor: hematomas usually resolve on their own, but larger or more painful hematomas may require surgery or the RICE method (rest, ice, compression, and elevation)
 Symptoms: A severe, worsening headache, vision changes, confusion, hearing loss, personality changes, loss of movement, difficulty walking, loss of consciousness, or seizures 
Risk factors: Age, playing high-impact sports, taking blood thinners, or having hemophilia 

This video from Skilled Wound Care explains what a hematoma is and how it's managed:

Hematomas are different from bruises, which are caused by blood leaking from smaller blood vessels and appear as a purple, blue, or darkened spot on the skin.
